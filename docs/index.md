# Official Imtec Android App
Application coded for Imtec Web Shop. First Android application I coded in kotlin and not in Java. Kotlin is amazing, expressive and fast. Switching application from Java to Kotlin significantly improved it's speed and shorten code size by 30% from original Java application.
